## Puggle
[Puggle] (http://puggleboard.com/) is an effort to create a fully programable, real-time, low-cost, data conversion and processing system for the [BeagleBone] (http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone).

## PuggleBoard
The [PuggleBoard] (https://potterlab.gatech.edu/main/newman/wiki/index.php?title=BoneClamp) is a four channel 16-bit analog I/O interface that plugs into the BeagleBone's expansion headers and is driven using the PuggleDriver set.
