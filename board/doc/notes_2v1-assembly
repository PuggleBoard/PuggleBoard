Notes on PuggleBoard v2.1 board assembly

X1. I screwed up the voltage reference filter again. By moving the first order RC network to the input side of the AD8032, a voltage divider was formed with the trimpot controlling the bias voltage, halfing the reference voltage. Just get rid of that resistor all together.

EDIT: 
+ That was not the problem. The real problem was that in the schematic the VREF_PRE signal was renamed VREF as it entered the input of the AD8302, which caused a bunch of miswirings. Gah.
+ I think that I did not pay enough attention to the ERC check on the schematic. This may have listed the fact that all three pins (IN-,+ and OUT) were connected on an opamp, and the problem could have been avoided.
+ In the meantime, i will pay for my sins by cutting traces with a blade and jumper wiring the correct circuit into these boards for testing purposes.

2. There was a problem with the resistors on the DAC or ADC buffer being too small and drawing too much current. I cant remember the details right now but I need to figure that out.
