Notes on PuggleBoard v2.0 board assembly

1. It looks like r45,46,47,48 are mislabeled on pcb (i.e. values are reversed and not updated to current value of 13.7k)

2. The TPS7A4901 and TPS7A3001 name labels are reversed on the board, causing me to install the chips in the incorrect positions. Lovely.
